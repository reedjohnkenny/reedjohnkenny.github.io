I am currently the project coordinator for the Cal Poly Slo Halter Ranch Conservation Scholars (HARCS) program. This is our inaugural year, and we will be placing six students in summer conservation and stewardship internships with our conservation partners.

Throughout my graduate career I served as a teaching assistant for courses in botany, ecology, and evolution. I have experience leading lab sections, teaching plant identification, and guiding students through field work.
