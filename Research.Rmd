### Urban forestry

In the wake of the 2025 fires in Altadena and Pacific Palisades there was a focus in some circles on which tree species seemed to have survived the fire and which may have been responsible for accelerating spread. This interest grew more urgent as CA's AB 3074 mandating 5ft of fully cleared space around structures neared full implementation. In 2025 I led an effort at the Urban Forest Institute to try and assess how the presence of urban trees in these fires impacted structure loss. This work is currently in review.

I am also part of an effort at the Urban Forest Institute to improve allometric equations for urban trees by leveraging data collected by professional tree companies during maintenance efforts and tree inventory projects. Through this work we hope to increase the number of urban trees with species specific allometric equations, especially important to California's diverse urban forest.

### Systematics of the Rush Family (Juncaceae)

I was lucky enough to be able to dive deep into the evolutionary history of the Rush family during my Ph.D. work. *Juncus* is a favorite group of mine and California is a global hotspot for *Juncus* diveristy. I am fascinated by the relationships between some of the annual taxa in *Juncus* found in California and some high elevation cushion plants found in the Andes and was able to shed more light on relationships in this diverse section of the family. This work has resulted in a publication which is currently in review at the American Journal of Botany.

### Hybrdization and species identity across the Calfifornia Flora

During my career as a field botanist and while conducting the floristic study that was my Master's thesis, I always had a deep desire to know what was going on with individuals that just did not seem to fit into their species definition. I was able to make inroads into these questions in a few taxa during my Ph.D., my focal group *Juncus* as well as an iconic endagered species *Fremontodendron decumbens*. Below are publications that led to and came out of this work.
