I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Urban Forest Institute based in San Luis Obispo California. I am interested in a variety of issues concerning urban trees including how urban trees interact with and are affected by urban conflagrations, urban tree allometry, and species selection for underserved communities. I earned a Master's degree at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo studying the floristics of the central California coast and a Ph.D. at the University of California Davis in the Ecology program, where I studied species relationships in the Juncaceae (Rush family).
